# Crealiti-ender-3--my-opinion
Ðœy take on Ender 3, how would I do it on a CNC machine.
here I will upload files in solidworks format. Version 2014. I will process the original files for the production of aluminum parts on the CNC machine.
Modifications will concern both technological and practical aspects of usability.
